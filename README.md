## Model Management System

A TypeScript project that implements type-safe `ModelManager` and `EventHandler` classes. The `ModelManager` class provides a builder pattern for configuring and managing models, while `EventHandler` offers a type-safe event-handling system for model-related events.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a type-safe approach to managing configurations and events in a TypeScript environment. It includes:

1. **ModelManager**: A builder class that allows you to set up and manage model configurations with strict type safety.
2. **EventHandler**: A class for registering and triggering events specific to each model type, ensuring only valid events can be registered and triggered.

## Features

- **Type-safe Model Configuration**: Ensure configurations conform to the modelâ€™s expected parameters and metadata.
- **Event Management**: Register and trigger events in a type-safe manner with `EventHandler`.
- **Error Handling**: Detects invalid configurations and events early, preventing runtime errors.
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests for configuration management and event handling.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- TypeScript
- Jest for testing
